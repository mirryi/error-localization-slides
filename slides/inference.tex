  \note[item]{In this program, the type of f is given to be unknown, so the bidirectional system
    would operate gradually and results in no marks}

    possible}
  \note[item]{In other ways, there's no way to replace the unknown type, or type hole as well we

  \note[item]{Without getting into the weeds of how exactly it all works---you can refer to the
    paper for the details---let's just take the previous example into our implementation of type
    hole inference in Hazel}
  \note[item]{This is a constraint-based inference system, so we gather constraints and try to solve
    them with a standard unification algorithm}
  \note[item]{When unification is able to solve the constraints, things proceed as normal to find
    the appropriate substitution}
  \note[item]{However, like here, when unsolvable, the system degrades gracefully to maintain
    partial solutions by accumulating the possible type fillings}
  \note[item]{So notice that the system has marked the unknown type, the type hole here as unsolvable}
  \note[item]{and the cursor inspector tells us that the constraints demand f be both an int and int
    -> unknown}
  \note[item]{Instead of failing, type hole inference collects and offers both possible fillings to
    the user, and if we hover over each, we can preview and then click to select the one we want}
  \note[item]{When hovering over Int, it fills Int into the type hole, and now the application of f
    is marked with an error because control has been returned to the bidirectional
    system}
  \note[item]{Similarly, hovering over Int -> ? results in the second f being marked with an error}

    simply provide all potential type hole fillings to the user for selection}
